# Phase-3 Project "Bucket list" frontend
This is a frontend application for Bucket list app I created for the end of phase-3 at Flatiron school. 
The focus of this project is building a Sinatra API backend that uses Active Record to access and persist data in a database, which will be used by a separate React frontend that interacts with the database via the API.
  
In this Backet List app user can keep truck of all everything he/she would like to do in the future: travel to desired places, experience new things, change your lifestyle or habits. 
User can add new items to the list and sort them by categories, mark them as complete and delete items from the list.
Hope you will enjoy it!
